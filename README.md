 I worked on analyzing JioSaavn’s music data using SQL. With 11 interconnected tables, I got to deep dive into various aspects of data management and analysis. 
 
Some key highlights include:
Complex Joins and Subqueries to extract valuable insights 🎯
Optimized Data Aggregation for user engagement analysis 📈
Querying large datasets for music trends and playlist patterns 🎵
Efficiently designed database schema to handle diverse relationships 🔗

This experience has sharpened my skills in:
Data Querying & Filtering 📊
Joins & Subqueries 🔍
Data Aggregation & Reporting 📑
Database Design & Optimization 💻


This project really helped sharpen my database skills and improved my understanding of how data supports decision-making in the music streaming industry!
